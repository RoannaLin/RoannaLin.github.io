<ol>

<li> Preheat oven to 350F (175C). Butter and flour a 9” x 5” (23cm x 13cm) loaf pan and set aside.</li>
<li>In the bowl of an electric mixer beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating in between each addition. Add vanilla and orange zest beat to combine. </li>
<li>In a medium bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
<li>Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, in thirds, alternating with the sour cream, until both are incorporated. </li>
<li>Transfer batter to the loaf pan, smooth out top and bake for 45-50 mins until a tooth pick comes out clean. NOTE: if top is beginning to brown too quickly, cover with a sheet of foil on top until fully baked through. </li>
<li>Allow cake to cool completely before releasing it from the pan. Place cake on a cooling rack, fitted into a sheet pan, to catch the glaze when cake is frosted.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
For candied oranges:
<li>Slice 2 oranges into 12 orange wheels (1/4” thick) each orange should give you 6 wheels.
In a large sauté pan combine sugar and water, simmer mixture until translucent and bubbling.</li> 
<li>Add oranges in a single layer. Simmer oranges for 3-4 mins each side and then transfer to a cooling rack (with a rimmed sheet pan underneath) to catch the drippings. </li>
</ol>
<ol>
For glaze:
<li>Squeeze the oranges that were striped of the zest for the cake, into 3 tablespoons of juice.
In a small bowl add powder sugar through a fine sieve to remove clumps. Then and juice, whisk until smooth. </li>
<li>Spoon glaze over the top of cake, allowing it to drip over the sides of the cake. Garnish with 2 rows of candied oranges, overlapping slightly to create a decorative design (alternate colors too, lighter with darker etc) </li>
<li>Place cake on a platter, garnish either side with fresh mint or orange blossom if you have them, and slice into thick slices. Serve with homemade whipped cream. Enjoy!</li>
